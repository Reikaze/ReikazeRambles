## Statement of Ethics

We never want to end up in a place where our educational content, experience,
or community is compromised by either financial sway or potentially harmful
members of the community. As such, we've implemented the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
as our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to uphold these values.

We also pledge to maintain transparency in regards to any finances that flow
through the project. Not every sponsorship contains a financial contribution,
but if one does we will disclose both what those finances
are going towards and what will be done in exchange.

## Important Repo Files

### Blog Posts

Should be located under [`content/blog/post-name-here`](./content/blog/).
You should then have an `index.md` file containing a frontmatter (with JS
header, not YAML) portion and any related files should be in the same folder.

### Author Data File
The author data file is located at [`src/data/unicorns.json`](./src/data/unicorns.json) ðŸ¦„

To add yourself as an author in a PR for a new post, you'd add your information
as a new JSON object in the array, then add a profile picture to the `data`
folder. The `pronouns` field should match an `id` in the `pronouns.json` (if
yours is not listed, please add it as a new value in that file, we've tried to
do our best to include everything we've found!)

> If you do not want to show a profile picture or commit your picture to
the repo, we have a [myriad of emotes that can be used as profile pictures as well](./content/assets/branding/emotes).
They're adorable, go check! ðŸ¤©

## ðŸš€ Develop

To start the develop server, run `npm run develop`, it will then start
the local instance at `http://localhost:8000`. You also have the ability to
checkout the GraphiQL tool at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a
 tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about
 using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

## Git Strategy

We loosely follow [the Gitflow branching strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
where our development branch is called `integration` and our mainline branch is called `master`.

This means that any new pull requests should be made against `integration`
unless it is an emergency hotfix (to be approved by the devops team).

We also have the `master` branch which is a live reflection of the code
hosted on the server. Any time `integration` is pulled into `master`, the
site will be deployed. A PR from `integration` to `master` should only be
opened by a Reikaze Rambles team member and must be approved by at
least one devops member
